Time series code for date based intervals.

I don't know if I'm bad at googling, but I've had a hard time finding time series code for getting stats on intervals for things like customer and product purchases on invoice or order data. For a lot of my ML work adding time oriented data features like time since a row of data had an event like a purchase compared to the mean or average interval of such purchases is important. Kind of surprised by the lack of example code on this issue. If there is other stuff out there feel free to email me at doug.macleod@smartcloudforge.com.
